# Assembly_Visualizing_and_Analysis
For these scripts, I am mainly visualizing the draft assembly as dot-lots against other assemblies. It is useful to have an idea of how big are your contains, the coverage you have, and so forth. 

1) Dotplots: it creates paf files usning minimap2 and uses paf2dotplot to create dotplots from those files.
2) This script extract a region from a contig of interest from an alignment and creates dotplots using mummer for visualizing specific loci.
